1. Applying Bayes' Theorem in Medical Diagnosis

Bayes' Theorem is used to find the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of
conditions related to the event. It is given by:

				 P(B∣A)⋅P(A)
		P(A∣B) =	------------
		           P(B)


Let's consider a medical diagnosis problem where:

𝐴: A is the event of having a disease.
𝐵: B is the event of testing positive for the disease.

Given:
	P(A) = Prior probability of having the disease.
	P(B∣A) = Probability of testing positive given having the disease (sensitivity).
	P(B∣¬A) = Probability of testing positive given not having the disease 
				(false positive rate)
    P(¬A)=1−P(A) = Probability of not having the disease.

    Using Bayes' Theorem, we calculate the posterior probability 𝑃(𝐴∣𝐵) 
    (the probability of having the disease given a positive test result):


    			         P(B∣A)⋅P(A)
    	P(A∣B)= ---------------------------
    	         P(B∣A)⋅P(A)+P(B∣¬A)⋅P(¬A)

Example: 
		
		P(A)=0.01 (1% prevalence of the disease).
		P(B∣A)=0.99 (99% sensitivity).
		P(B∣¬A)=0.05 (5% false positive rate).


		           0.99⋅0.01                  0.0099				0.0099
    P(A∣B)=  ------------------------  = ------------------- = --------- ≈ 0.1667 
	           0.99⋅0.01 + 0.05⋅0.99       0.0099 + 0.0495       0.0594

So, the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is approximately 16.67%.


2. Finding Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of a Given Matrix

For a matrix A, the eigenvalues λ and eigenvectors 𝑣 satisfy the equation:
Av=λv

This can be written as:
(A−λI)v=01

where,
I is the identity matrix. To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation:
det(A−λI)=0
